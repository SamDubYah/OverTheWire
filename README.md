# OverTheWire
Scripts used to automate over the wire games

Only script available at the moment is for Bandit, though the script should be easily modifiable for other game variants

Script usage is self explanitory. Unless a 'n' or 'N' is entered when exiting the current level it will connect to the next level. 

For ease of use Copy the code from the current level, and past into terminal when prompted for password on next level.
